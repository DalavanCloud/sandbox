* EINS *

Add an X-axis bucket, then click the Aggregation drop-down menu and select "Date Histogram". Click the Apply button, the single bar will split into several bars along the X-axis.
Now the Count is displayed as multiple bars, divided into intervals of time (which can be modified by selecting an interval from the drop-down).

Click the Add Sub Aggregation button. Select the Split Bars bucket type. Click the Sub Aggregation drop-down menu and select "Significant Terms", then click the Field drop-down menu and select "clientip.raw", then click the Size field and enter "10". Click the Apply button to create the new graph.

Create a pie chart of your top 5 (highest count) log "types". To do this, click Visualize then select Pie chart. Then use a new search, and leave the search as "" (i.e. all of your logs).
Then select "Split Slices" bucket. Click the Aggregation drop-down and select "Significant Terms", click the Field drop-down and select "type.raw", then click the Size field and enter "5".
Now click the Apply button and save the visualization as "Top 5".
